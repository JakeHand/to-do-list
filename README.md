# To Do List
In this project I made a simple to do list using Javascript. In this project I neglected styling and focussed on the Javascript functionality of the app.

I found this beginner project very easy until I came up against adding multiple elements on an event. It took me ages to figure how to do this and add child elements to a newly created element. My problem here was setting the parent element an id instead of a classlist.

I am so relieved to have figured this out. Now onto the next project!
